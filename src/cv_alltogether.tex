        \emph{Graduate student at University doing research in Field}, with interests spanning
        \emph{subfield of field}, adjacent topic, and methods people use to study these things.

        My work combines \emph{computational approach, theoretical framework, and standard techniques} to investigate
        questions about systems in this domain. I am drawn to \emph{particular aspect of field}
        and applying established methods to relevant problems that need solving.
        I work at the intersection of discipline studying X
        and discipline studying Y.
